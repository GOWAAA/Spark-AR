# Native UI Multiple Sliders

[Picker textures](https://github.com/positlabs/spark-picker-number-icons) by @positlabs

The code will use any texture that has a name that starts with `icon`. And will create a patch from script variable called `setting[1-9]` (There's no limit to a picker's length in theory).

This code will be updated in the near future to add some more features.

The lines to change the default `slider.value` and start picker `selectedIndex` can be found at the top.
