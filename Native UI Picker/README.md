# Native UI Picker
To use the files, create a script in Spark AR (Add Assets button) and copy paste the contents of the file you choose to it, or download the file and drag it into spark

If you don't really understand javascript or code as a whole (like when I started) I'd recommend using the version with comments, it has `// little things like this (comments)` that don't change the result but will tell you what you can change, what the result of doing so will be, and what you shouldn't

If you know what you're doing feel free to use the version without comments (Picker.js) and change it as you wish
