# Spark-AR
Repository of useful code I've used on instagram filters, you can see the filters at my instagram [tomaspietravallo](www.instagram.com/tomaspietravallo). If you are curious about any of the features used on any of the filters, I'm more than happy to help / add part of the project here

All of the files in the repository are subject to the licence, if whole projects or patch assets are uploaded there may be third party files like [Josh Beckwith's LUT Patch](https://github.com/positlabs/spark-lut-patch) which are subject to their own separate licences. 

I can't believe I have to say this but this repository is for learning, don't take whole projects and put them up for sale, it's only discouraging to me because I take the time to put things up together nicely for free, so the community can grow. Please use this as learning material and make your own project from that

All of the code works with v85 (or the version of spark at the time of upload) & promises

Feel free to contribute with your own code or to contact me for any reason (I'll probably answer faster through Instagram)
