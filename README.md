# Spark-AR
Repository of useful code used on instagram filters, you can see the filters at my instagram [@tomaspietravallo](www.instagram.com/tomaspietravallo). If you are curious about any of the features used on any of the filters, I'm more than happy help / add part of the project here

All of the files in the repository are subject to the licence, there may be third party files like [Josh Beckwith's LUT Patch](https://github.com/positlabs/spark-lut-patch) which are subject to their own separate licences. 

Feel free to contact me for any reason (I'll probably answer faster through Instagram)
